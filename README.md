CISA research is focused upon the development of foundational theories, methods and tools for addressing challenges characterized as system-of-systems. Pursuit of this focus includes establishment of an effective frame of reference, crafting of a common lexicon, and study of various modeling and simulation techniques, including probabilistic robust design (e.g., uncertainty modeling/management), agent-based modeling, network theory, object oriented simulations, and tools for capturing the interaction of requirements, concepts, and technologies. The Center seeks to advance the "science of integration" in multiple domains, including especially Next-generation Air Transportation Architectures (especially including the presence of revolutionary aerospace vehicles, new business models, and alternate policy constructs), integrated defense/command and control/battle management, human and robotic space exploration, and several others.
